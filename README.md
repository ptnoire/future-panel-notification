A quick static version of my moving div effect, this one is more stylized since I didn't have to run the JS as much, I just played with the CSS. You could combine this with the other one to get the two effects to merge if you were willing.

Sorry, I was in a hurry on this one. I felt like the style to my last 'moving-div' project was pretty weak because I spent all the time on the JS functionality. So this is a stic version of the last one, I also added in a 'flicker' effect as the old consoles logging in and warming up. So it's technically a 2 for 1.

In my life, my 2nd daughter was just born, I am very tired but I enjoy doing these. Sorry if my logic was off for the next little while, I could just be saying 'whatever' and making it work regardless of keeping these as easily 'drop in' - able as possible. With a little magic, you can rework these and still use them just fine for your projects. - Much love from PT
